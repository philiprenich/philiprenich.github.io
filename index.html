	<p>I am a one-man <b>web development studio</b> based in Portland, Oregon who collaborates with other <strong>talented</strong> individuals with complementing skill sets to enable people and companies to achieve their goals and live their passions by <b>creating beautiful, usable websites</b>.</p>
	<p>Together with friends, I offer <b>research, design, development, user experience, and content strategy</b>. I know a few photographers and videographers as well if you need help there. The world is a large and varied place so I create <b>responsive websites</b> that are available on as many devices, and accessible to as many people, as possible.</p>
	<p>My favorite clients are those who strive to make the <b>community</b> they belong to, be it local or global, a better place. Like the non-profit in Mongolia doing educational development, or the one here in Portland that helps women and children who are at risk; like the local author and pastor who is supporting and caring for his neighborhood; like the photographers who believe in doing their best work to capture the beauty of marriage; and like the publishing house that sells books to help young men and women grow up to be people of integrity.</p>
	<p>I&#39;ve been doing this for a long time and <b>care</b> about doing great work with great people. If you feel you could fit into that list above, awesome, <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">let&#39;s talk</a>!</p>
