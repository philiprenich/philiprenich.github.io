				Originally hired for my knowledge and interest in responsive design practices, I quickly grew into a more over-arching front-end position with a heavy lean into complex web application development using Backbone.js, our own custom rolled framework, and Ruby on Rails I filled a hybrid role between the UX designers and the UI developers.

				After a six month contract with Real Pro System, I was asked to come on staff as a their main front-end developer. I worked to create new designs for their turn-key solution. In addition I maintained the corporate site and help implement custom client requests. I spent most of my day in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

				I started pursuing web design as a business in 2000. I design and maintain websites for a number of clients, both local and international. I am quick to learn and adapt in this environment. As a one-man business, I am responsible for sales, marketing, public relations, finances, design, and programming.

			<p class="description">
				I volunteered every year or two to work for a tour as part of the technical crew for IWT, a group of world traveling stage performers. The job evolved from grunt labor to directing and producing live video to leading the technical team. It was a huge learning experience working with a variety of teams of international performers and crew, often in high stress situations.

				While in Europe I took the bold step of going to countries where I did not speak the language to help a Christian missionary organization build their websites. These sites had to be setup to facilitate an international audience, designed for multiple languages.
